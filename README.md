# Attalus: A Sega Master System Emulator

Attalus is an emulator for the Sega Master System. It's not ready for prime
time yet, but the goal is to produce an emulator that is suitable for
interactive use as well as for training of AI video game players.

Current work is on a software interpreter. In the future I'll also develop a
dynamic translator to x64 machine instructions, allowing very fast execution.
This will be in support of training AI players.
